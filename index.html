                The students can learn writing skills, creativity, communication, and cooperation by using technology in
                learning, so, it will improve the students’ skills and competencies.
                Using laptops in classrooms will help the students to learn to type quickly and accurately, they can
                record notes much faster than writing by hand. Technology is used in conducting research, developing the

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Coding tests a variety of abilities. It hones problem-solving and analysis skills, such as finding
                errors and thinking logically. Further, coding often helps people develop teamwork and interpersonal
                skills since software and application projects are often cross-disciplinary and collaborative.

                Perhaps coding’s biggest attraction is that almost anyone can learn it. Aspiring coders don’t
                necessarily need to be experts in math or have vast prior experience. To get started, they simply need
                to be inquisitive, committed to learning, and willing to practice their coding skills regularly while
                learning from their mistakes. This accessibility makes coding a potential path for career switchers and
                brand-new professionals alike. .</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                The best way to introduce your child to a computer is to start them on a family laptop or desktop rather
                than a tablet or phone. Why? This limits the child's access and allows you to teach them the basics:
                such as how to turn the computer on and off and how to open and close the software.
                By approaching computer science as a flexible tool that is vital in many disciplines, students will
                appreciate how learning to program can benefit them in whatever career path they chose. Teachers in all
                content areas can also see the value in integrating computer science principles in their practice.
